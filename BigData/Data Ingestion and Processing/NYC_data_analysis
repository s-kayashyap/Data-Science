-- The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission [TLC] Data Analysis
--
-- Scope                 : The dataset provided by TLC contains the detailed trip level data of trips made
--                         by yellow taxis for the months of November and December 2017 in New York City.
--                         Our aim is to do the analysis based on the concepts of Ingesting and Big Data
--                         Processing on the APACHE-HIVE platform.
--
-- Uses                  : Purpose of this analysis is to get a better understanding of the taxi system,
--                         so that the city of New York can improve the efficiency of in-city commutes.
--
--Database tables        : 1. prem_nyc_taxi (original tables)
--                         2. prem_nyc_taxi_partition_orc (created dynamic partitioned table to improve the performance)
--                         3. prem_nyc_taxi_bucket (created 5 bucket to improve the performance)
-- 
-- Input datasets ->

--                       : Both the dataset have similar information. Following are the important fields
--                         which we have in the dataset.
-- 1.  vendorid--A code indicating the TPEP provider that provided the record. 1= Creative Mobile Technologies, LLC; 2= VeriFone Inc. 
-- 2.  tpep_pickup_timestamp--The date and time when the meter was engaged.
-- 3.  tpep_dropoff_timestamp--The date and time when the meter was disengaged.
-- 4.  passenger_count--The number of passengers in the vehicle. This is a driver-entered value.
-- 5.  trip_distance--The elapsed trip distance in miles reported by the taximeter.
-- 6.  rate_code--The final rate code in effect at the end of the trip. 1= Standard rate 2=JFK 3=Newark 4=Nassau or Westchester 5=Negotiated fare 6=Group ride.
-- 7.  store_forward_flag--This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor, aka store and forward, because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server. Y= store and forward trip N= not a store and forward trip.
-- 8.  pickup_location--TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was engaged.
-- 9.  dropoff_location--TLC Taxi Zone in which the taximeter was disengaged.
-- 10. payment_type--A numeric code signifying how the passenger paid for the trip. 1= Credit card 2= Cash 3= No charge 4= Dispute 5= Unknown 6= Voided trip.
-- 11. fare_charge--The time-and-distance fare calculated by the meter.
-- 12. extra_charge--Miscellaneous extras and surcharges. Currently, this only includes the $0.50 and $1 rush hour and overnight charges.
-- 13. mta_tax_charge--$0.50 MTA tax that is automatically triggered based on the metered rate in use.
-- 14. tip_amount--Tip amount – This field is automatically populated for credit card tips. Cash tips are not included.
-- 15. tolls_charge--Total amount of all tolls paid in trip.
-- 16. improvement_surcharge--$0.30 improvement surcharge assessed trips at the flag drop. The improvement surcharge began being levied in 2015.
-- 17. total_charge--The total amount charged to passengers. It does not include cash tips.

--I will be utilizing the Hadoop platform and HDFS for the analysis of the dataset and the queries will be written and executed from a HUE notebook.
--Following Action need to be performed:
--1. Create three directory /user/skashyap733_gmail/mydata/nyc_texi_data, /user/skashyap733_gmail/mydata/nyc_texi_data/partition, /user/skashyap733_gmail/mydata/nyc_texi_data/bucket to keep this datasets. 
--2. Copy the datasets into this directory through web console by using following command.
--    hadoop fs -cp /common_folder/nyc_taxi_data/* /user/skashyap733_gmail/mydata/nyc_texi_data/*
--3. Launch Hue Interface and execute the queries on notebook.

--         C. As from the sequence of tpep_pickup_timestamp and tpep_dropoff_timestamp analysis 1419 records are erroneous.

--	  1419
--        D. As from the passenger count analysis below.There are few records which have num of passenger more then 6

--         F. As from the payment_type analysis below we can see that as per our agreement in data dictionary

--     3	     100530
--     4	     27529
--
--         G. As from the extra_charge analysis we can see that there is few records which is 
--          having value less then 0 which is not practically possible. There are 44 distinct extra_charge 
--          values in the dataset Ranging between -$48.64 and $69.8. However, the extra_charge is a surcharge that can only take up $0.5 and $1.
--
--         H. As from the mta_tax_charge analysis we can see that there are 19 distinct mta_tax_charge
--            values in the dataset Ranging between -$0.5 and $117.85. The data dictionary specified that mta_tax_charge of $0.5.
--            Therefore, it can only take up two values $0 or $0.5.
--
--         I. As from the tip amount analysis we can see that there are 3 records which is inconsistent.
-- tip_amount	num_records
-- 4	            1
-- 20.65          	1
-- 1.8	            1
--
--         J. As from the improvement_surcharge analysis below we can see that there are 5 distinct values of improvement_surcharge ranging between -$0.3 and $1.
--            The improvement_surcharge of $0.3 began being levied on assessed trips at flag drop this means that
--            the improvement_surcharge can only take up $0 or $0.3 .
-- improvement_surcharge	num_records
--     -0.3	                 9367
--     0	                 4916
--     0.3	                 18778750

--     1	                 45
--
--         K. As from the total_charge analysis we can see that there is few records which is 
--          having value less then 0 which is not practically possible. So these data is not consistent. 

-- Q3. You might have encountered unusual or erroneous rows in the dataset. Can you conclude which vendor is doing a bad job in providing the records?

-- Q4. What is the average tip paid? Compare the average tip with the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and

--

FROM prem_nyc_taxi_partition_orc
WHERE payment_type != 2;


--
-- Ans 4. There is $0.683 difference between the average_tip - median_tip (50th percentile]), this difference constitutes to 39.50% of the inter-quartile range.
         Therefore, there is significant skewness in the distribution of the tip_amount parameter. This implies that the Average Tip is sqewed to the right of
		 the Median_tip. This may be offset due to certain records having higher tip_amount values. Therefore, in this situation Average_Tip is not representative
		 of central tendency. We can consider Median_Tip as a better representative of central tendency.

--

--
-- Ans 4. Average speed at 31st December (New year’s eve) is 14.091 MPH and Average speed at 25th December (Christmas Eve) is 16.859 MPH.
--        Which is significantly higher than overall average speed which is 12.659 MPH.
